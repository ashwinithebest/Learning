undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object
null is a keyword, but undefined is a normal identifier \

 It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.
 A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the BigInt() function.
 JavaScript strings are immutable.
 A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property #Javascript
